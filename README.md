# FirefightingDrone

# Project Overview
A problem shared by all fire-fighters regardless if they work in rural or urban environments is time. As a result, the growing list of applications for drone technology and in response to this problem, Inferno will be designed to effectively aid first-respondents by arriving at the scene up to ten minutes before they can. By creating a user-friendly interface and GPS-intensive algorithms, 911 operators will be able to pinpoint a location within seconds thus immediately deploying the drone to a fire where it can collect valuable data easily accessible by any fireman via cellular device.

# Development Process
1.    Finish user-interface; capabilities include address-search, flight path visualization, and flight analysis.
2.    Obtain materials once financial needs have been fulfilled.
3.    Construct quadcopter using the materials acquired.
4.    Develop firmware to upload to the drone’s flight controller. This will give it the ability to navigate autonomously.
5.    Enable the web-application to communicate to the flight controller via wireless connection.
6.    Test completed prototype in a controlled environment.
7.    Collect data regarding the prototype’s performance and make improvements based on the results.
8.    Acquire various patents necessary for protecting our design.
9.    Discuss possible applications of our technology with FAA officials and consult with engineering firms to approve our design and possibly begin distribution.

# Goals
 Currently, we have developed a web-based interface as seen above which, using the Google Maps API, is capable of displaying a path from a fire station to any address while providing valuable information such as distance, flight time, and latitude and longitude coordinates which will later be integrated into the drone’s flight controller. On arrival of its destination, the drone will be able to collect important data such as temperature and the presence of any harmful chemical agents. In addition to the information provided by the sensors, by utilizing a standard and infrared camera, the drone will allow firefighters to receive a bird’s-eye view of their environment. Given this advantage, the first-responders will have knowledge of the fire’s dissemination prior to entering the building and will know exactly where the fire is most-intense so authorities are able to make decisions based on the information received such as the point of entry.
